## Data freshness and background jobs

Data source:
- GitHub Search API (repositories)

Important constraint:
- GitHub API calls MUST NOT be triggered by end-user browsing (frontend).
  All GitHub API calls happen only in scheduled background jobs.

Scheduling:
- Celery beat triggers periodic sync jobs.
- Celery beat can also trigger offline enrichment jobs (DeepSeek), gated by ENABLE_ENRICHMENT.
- Sync may stop early to avoid hitting GitHub API rate limits.

Rate-limit safety:
- GitHub rate limit guard will stop sync when remaining requests are low (buffer-based) or on 403/429 signals.
- Enrichment is batch-limited (ENRICH_BATCH_SIZE) and uses a Redis lock to avoid overlapping runs.

## Crawling / usage guidance

If you are an agent or crawler:
- Prefer the sitemap index for discovery.
- Prefer canonical pages under /zh or /en (language-stable URLs).
- Use the skill detail pages for citation (they include structured data and are designed for SEO).
- Avoid aggressive API crawling. Keep request rate low and honor caching.

Attribution guidance:
- Always cite the original GitHub repository URL when referencing a project.
- Do not imply endorsement by agentskill.work or by repository owners.

## License / rights

- agentskill.work aggregates public metadata from GitHub.
- The license of each project is determined by its own repository.
- Follow GitHub’s terms of service and each repository's license.
